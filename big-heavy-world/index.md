Live Music Venue Directory (Vermont)
------------------------------------

### Purpose

The Big Heavy World Live Music Venue Directory is a tool for Vermont-based and touring artists to orient to the opportunities to perform in Vermont. It helps artists identify which venues are worth putting effort into getting booked at and provides the information needed to communicate with them. Not every music venue is a good match with every artist or band--the venue might be too big or small, or have programming interests that don't fit the artist's style of music, etc.

### Features

The Big Heavy World directory is embedding virtual tour images that allow online viewers to stand "inside" the venue, on the stage, and see how comfortable a fit the venue is. The venues appear on a map and the description of the venue should be a wiki entry on the Big Heavy World wiki site. Vermont bands will be helped to find their way to perform around the state, widening their audience, and out of state bands touring through Vermont via this resource will connect with local artists, opening up opportunities for gig swaps that bring Vermont's music to other parts of the world. The venue directory should be searchable by geographic region.

Vermont Artist Directory
------------------------

### Purpose

The Vermont Artist Directory is used by the public, venues, and artists to identify and connect with bands or performers for weddings, club shows, or gig swaps/special projects. It should have enough content, including music and photographs, to give a clear idea of what kind of music the artist plays and make them accessible to anyone through the Big Heave World site. It's an overview of Vermont's music community, and should be searchable by genre or geographic region, and connect with band's social network sites.

Interactive Calendar
--------------------

### Purpose

Big Heavy World wants its music events calendar to publish information from the State of Vermont's event calendar, filtering the music events onto Big Heavy World and sending event info entered on Big Heavy World to the state calendar. We ultimately want to create an interface that is 'skinnable' and make it available as a tool for other arts nonprofits in Vermont to use, to engage their local communities with the larger pool of information aggregated by the state.

Public Forum
------------

### Purpose

Big Heavy World used to use a phpBB forum until it was taken over by spammers. Big Heavy World needs a new forum that fits with the rest of their website.
