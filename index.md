Goal
----

The first year goal of Code for BTV is to facilitate sustainable collaboration on civic software between coders, designers, and civic organizations. Code for BTV will develop a pipeline of civic organizations in need of civic software, as well as a pipeline of coders and designers able to develop, deploy, and maintain civic software and infrastructure.

### Vision

There are many civic organizations in need of coding and design capacity. While these organizations may be able to find short term help through volunteers or one-time grants, building long term capacity is a larger challenge. At the same time, aspiring coders and designers seek to gain experience through work on real projects while professionals are looking for projects on which to experiment with new technologies or approaches.

The Burlington, Vermont area has a very active community of technologists including the Burlington Web Application Group, the Vermont.NET User Group, and an annual event called Vermont Code Camp. These existing channels can be utilized to recruit Code for BTV members.

### Values

Vermonters value participatory government and civic engagement as manifest in traditions such as Town Meeting Day. Code for BTV believes that by working together we can create and sustain civic software and infrastructure that will improve our communities. Code for BTV recognizes the value of sharing both our tools and our data allowing others to build on our work.

### Mission

The mission of Code for BTV is to develop, deploy, and maintain modern civic software and infrastructure for the benefit of the people and civic organizations in the Burlington, Vermont metropolitan area. Domain-specific civic software will be created for the people and civic organizations served. Organizations will be encouraged to open their data allowing for an infrastructure of open data to emerge as more-and-more organizations are served.

### Background

The State of Vermont and county governments have outsourced many human services to non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Many governmental programs are run through these NGOs. Municipalities often partner with NGOs for economic development initiatives. These NGOs bridge the gap between governments and the people. The focus of Code for BTV is to work with these civic organizations.

Schedule

### Meetups

TDB

### Campaigns

Each campaign will focus on developing, deploying, and maintaining modern civic software for a given civic organizations. Each campaign will bring on a new civic organization while continuing to support those that came before. Leaders, coders, and designers will be recruited specifically for each campaign.

#### Summer Campaign

Code for BTV will launch with the [National Day of Civic Hacking](http://hackforchange.org/) on June 1-2, 2013. Its initial campaign will involve building a set of web apps for Big Heavy World, a volunteer-staffed nonprofit dedicated to preserving and promoting Vermont-made music. These apps will be part of a redesigned bigheavyworld.com, a web site providing resources and community-building for Vermont-based musicians and Vermont's music fans. While this campaign will begin on the National Day of Civic Hacking, this will be just the beginning of a long term effort.

Big Heavy World's apps will be built using HTML5 and other modern web technologies and will make its Vermont music industry directories, interviews, and audio and visual content readily accessible to mobile and accessibility devices. Each component of the web site will be reconstructed as open-source software, enabling other communities and municipal and state governments to leverage these tools for their own music offices based on the Big Heavy World programming. The bigheavyworld.com site was launched first in 1996 and rebuilt in 2005. The new version will make it functional well into the future and create opportunities to employ emerging and future web technologies to serve Vermont music.

Big Heavy World has had a high level of success in harnessing the power of volunteers. However, developing and maintaining its web site through volunteers has proven to be a challenge. A new approach is needed that focuses on long term sustainability. Code for BTV's focus on long term sustainability combined with Big Heavy World's success in recruiting volunteers represents a new approach to addressing this issue of maintainability.
