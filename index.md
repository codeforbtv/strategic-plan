#### Summer Campaign

Code for BTV will launch with the [National Day of Civic Hacking](http://hackforchange.org/) on June 1-2, 2013. Its initial campaign will involve building a set of web apps for Big Heavy World, a volunteer-staffed nonprofit dedicated to preserving and promoting Vermont-made music. These apps will be part of a redesigned bigheavyworld.com, a web site providing resources and community-building for Vermont-based musicians and Vermont's music fans.

Big Heavy World's apps will be built using HTML5 and other modern web technologies and will make its Vermont music industry directories, interviews, and audio and visual content readily accessible to mobile and accessibility devices. Each component of the web site will be reconstructed as open-source software, enabling other communities and municipal and state governments to establish music offices of their own based on the Big Heavy World programming. The bigheavyworld.com site was launched first in 1996 and rebuilt in 2005. The new version will make it functional well into the future and create opportunities to employ emerging and future web technologies to serve Vermont music.
