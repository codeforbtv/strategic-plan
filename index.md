Goal
----

The first year goal of Code for BTV is to facilitate sustainable collaboration on civic software between coders, designers, and civic organizations.

### Vision

There are many civic organizations in need of coding and design capacity. While these organizations may be able to find short term help through volunteers or one-time grants, building long term capacity is a larger challenge. At the same time, aspiring coders and designers seek to gain experience through work on real projects while professionals are looking for projects on which to experiment with new technologies or approaches.

### Values

Vermonters value participatory government and civic engagement as manifest in traditions such as Town Meeting Day. We believe that by working together we can create and sustain civic software and infrastructure that will improve our communities. We recognize the value of sharing both our tools and our data allowing others to build on our work.

### Mission

The mission of Code for BTV is to develop, deploy, and maintain modern civic software and infrastructure for Burlington, Vermont.

### Background

The State of Vermont and county governments have outsourced many human services to non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Many governmental programs are run through these NGOs. Municipalities often partner with NGOs for economic development initiatives. These NGOs bridge the gap between governments and the people. The focus of Code for BTV will be working with these civic organizations.

#### Summer Campaign

Code for BTV will launch with the [National Day of Civic Hacking](http://hackforchange.org/) on June 1-2, 2013. Its initial campaign will involve building a set of web apps for Big Heavy World, a volunteer-staffed nonprofit dedicated to preserving and promoting Vermont-made music. These apps will be part of a redesigned bigheavyworld.com, a web site providing resources and community-building for Vermont-based musicians and Vermont's music fans.

Big Heavy World's apps will be built using HTML5 and other modern web technologies and will make its Vermont music industry directories, interviews, and audio and visual content readily accessible to mobile and accessibility devices. Each component of the web site will be reconstructed as open-source software, enabling other communities and municipal and state governments to establish music offices of their own based on the Big Heavy World programming. The bigheavyworld.com site was launched first in 1996 and rebuilt in 2005. The new version will make it functional well into the future and create opportunities to employ emerging and future web technologies to serve Vermont music.
